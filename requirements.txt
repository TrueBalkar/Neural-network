To start working with this program you will need to install python and some libraries for python,
through pip install. It is highly advisable for you to install python 3.9, 
as this program was tested only on python 3.9.
After you download and install python, use console command pip install name_of_the_module
to download the next modules:

# Modules:
TensorFlow (pip install tensorflow)
Patchify (pip install patchify)
Segmentation models (pip install segmentation_models)
NumPy (pip install numpy)
Pandas (pip install pandas)
OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)
PIL (pip install Pillow)
sklearn (pip install scipy scikit-learn)
MatPlotLib (pip install matplotlib)
