# Winstars Technology. Test task for Internship in Data Science.
# Project goal
The goal of the test project is to build a semantic segmentation model. Prefered tools and notes: tf.keras, Unet architecture for neural network, dice score, python. 
# Configuration instructions 
Before you can run this scipts, you need to be sure, that every needed library from requirenments.txt is installed. And you can run it.
# Installation instructions 
Download dataset, if you want to train this model, or use pre trained model in model directory.
